# HârnWorld Location Module: Erone Abbey

Erone Abbey is a "Location Module"; it is designed to depict the Erone Abbey and
village located just south of Tashal, kingdom of Kaldor, on
the island of Hârn in the [HârnWorld](https://columbiagames.com/harnworld/) fantasy
setting; however, this abbey could be adapted to exist anywhere in any fantasy setting.

Although designed for use with the [HârnMaster](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/hm3)
system, this module is mostly system-agnostic.  Detailed descriptions of the actors
has been provided in journal entries to facilitate conversion to other game systems.

The abbey is held by the Peonian Pelnala Velira Siwen, abbess of Erone.  Erone Abbey
is widely known as a place of healing and peace, and the waters of its natural hot
springs are widely considered therapeutic.
