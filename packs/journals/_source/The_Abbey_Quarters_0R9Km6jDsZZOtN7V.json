Long considered therapeutic by the Jarin, Erone has been a popular pilgrimage site for a thousand years. Drawn by its healing waters, the Peonians established an abbey here in 335TR. Originally, pilgrims bathed directly in the pool at the base of the small cliff. Over time, the sides of the pond were worn smooth and several sick and weak pilgrims were unable to get out on their own and had to be rescued. To remedy the problem, a chapel was built and the water funnelled into a stepped pool. Some pilgrims still insist on bathing in the open pond, but most prefer the sanctity and ease of the chapel pool.</p>",

One day, while trying to come up with grand sounding names, one of the nuns joked that the northeast corner should be called the spring quarter because that is where the spring was. This led to a lively discussion. Obviously, the cemetery in the southeast corner represented the end of life, and so was obviously the winter quarter. The southwest corner, with its tithe barn filled with the harvest from the fields was the autumn quarter. That left the northwest corner, with its great temple surrounded by trees and lush grass as the summer quarter. All of this neatly fit into the cycle of seasons. Only Peoni could have inspired such divine simplicity, and so, with a clap of her hands, the Abbess said, “Let it be so.” And thus were the four quarters named.</p>\n<h2>Spring Quarter</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.ttNnz7n8DflQIdpT]{Hot Springs}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.2BFef11O0wV8e7J4]{Tirrala’s Chapel}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.a8wUEQpqAMv3KAnS]{Abbey Holy Symbol}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.uVVMHCmHGlFjXstr]{Hospital}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.vDT1yaAqkrinMz2F]{Herb Garden}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.Wp4642wVdn4oCPt8]{Yselde’s Chapel}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.uWfNR2IZgFXq9uI2]{Rivulet}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.JXPI7otyFs8aEyFS]{Esolani’s Dorter 1}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.3PGxNfUlsxQ1xWYH]{Hedge and Ditch}</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Summer Quarter</h2>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.Ewp4zXm5G2WlPGfu]{Pelnala’s House}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.xZqqjngNNRzaQ3vR]{Ebasethe’s Dorter}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.8Zl2VRtyyGmogPqp]{Archives}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.IVhgeWjKNgjhkqop]{Belsirasin’s Chapel}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.91UhwtXfJ1qmGtfW]{Library and Scriptorium}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.rlT1WrbbI1YsT6mz]{Herbarium / Apothecary}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.Z4gjQG59yL1lV7dO]{Lady Besnia’s House}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.GNBLzWCOlEJ10nuW]{Peoni’s Temple}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.ejzK68LfzXilagIF]{Main Gate}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.uhTR8MGfQGFaY7Mh]{Reception}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.yonGOSis9ijGcHRY]{Mill}</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Autumn Quarter</h2>\n<ol start=\"21\">\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.cDtKRFodJacz75e7]{Tithe Barn}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.QVxvGnEJNE5F1BaO]{Stables}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.59Oe909KUFcLtdNr]{Brewery}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.vcXzRj1wPNxNzUoD]{Brew Mistress’ House}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.7OvaHYznMOZtYjWN]{Baker’s House}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.NI1iIFdyEHISctjA]{Bakery}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.eaLWPn6tV2YNozAp]{Esolani’s Dorter 2}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.XFvcIC5mkREnh8Si]{Head Cook’s House}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.pSOw4229Mf3KPVfs]{Kitchen}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.nWX6GdTXrsltJ0Bz]{Kitchen Annex}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.g7MocwiATdlDYZGx]{Guest Lodge}</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Winter Quarter</h2>\n<ol start=\"32\">\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.LBH73ochvTpng0zU]{Kitchen Garden}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.YPMBrGa2s5IVOGLd]{Refectory}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.OBTiRrPorMG6ZqmO]{Traveller’s Hostel}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.FOOsMIgnN7UnIHDW]{Back Gate}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.47QKL3znQYhIgtgU]{Maermal’s Chapel}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.uNqmMgKSmCaGLvS7]{Meadows of Valon}</li>\n</ol>",

Funded by the Physician‘s Guild, a surgeon’s knife and urn is carved over the door. A priestess is always present, day or night, to receive pilgrims’ sincere confession. Then, the priestess leads pilgrims down the steps into the warm, inviting waters. Once immersed in the pool, the supplicant is plunged completely into the healing waters four times. This washes away their sins and cleanses their body of all spiritual impurities. Many miracles have occurred here, especially among those who drink deeply of the waters with each plunge. Small glazed and stoppered clay jars are available so pilgrims can take some of the healing waters home with them. Offerings are gratefully accepted, but not required.</p>",

Despite the large amount of food grown on the demesne farm, the significant tithes paid by the tenants, and donations from surrounding manors, the food stored here must provide for the patients in the hospital (60+), provide alms to the poor (locals, travellers and 40+/- guests in the hostel), and feed the members of the abbey (90+ people). This requires careful management to ensure there is enough to last through the whole year. Sister Sabal reports to the Avasana. The sisters in the archives assist her with record keeping; several lay brothers and male villagers (familia) do the heavy labour. Despite her fine stewardship, it is always a challenge to feed the abbey throughout the year. Often, just prior to harvest, Sister Sabal has to be creative to meet the abbey’s needs.</p>",
