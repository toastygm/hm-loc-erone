Erone Abbey is famous throughout Kaldor (and beyond) for its temple, hospital and healing spring. A simple, but elegant Peonian church sits atop a small hill overlooking the main road. The vast majority of Peonian travellers (and some Laranians) stop to pray at the temple and leave an offering. The abbey relies on the generosity of travellers and the donations pay for the support of many patients and guests. The heart and soul of the abbey is its large hospital and Tirrala’s Chapel. The nuns are known for their healing skills and the chapel has been the scene of many miracles. The abbey also provides shelter for needy travellers and generous alms for the poor.</p>",
